## Our problem
The world of Pokemon is full of many fascinating creatures. Most of these pokemon can be found many places around the world, but a select few are one-of-a-kind. These are called Legendary Pokemon, and they tend to be larger and stronger than the rest. We want to use a classification algorithm to predict whether a given pokemon is legendary or not. We will use variables such as height, weight, and in-game stats such as "attack", "defense", and "speed" to carefully draw the line.
